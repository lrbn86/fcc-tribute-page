# freecodecamp.org Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Tribute Page
## Objective
Build a web app that functions as a tribute page with the following user stories.
## User Stories
1. My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.
2. I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").
3. I should see a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".
4. Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".
5. Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.
6. I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.
7. I should see an anchor element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to blank in order for your link to open in a new tab
8. The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
9. The img element should be centered within its parent element.
