      <p>Frédéric Chopin was a Polish composer and a virtuoso pianist of the Romantic era who wrote primarily for solo piano.</p>
      <p>His piano writing was technically demanding and expanded the limit of the instrument, his own performances noted for their nuance and sensitivity. His major piano works also included mazurkas, waltzes, nocturnes, polonaises, the instrumental ballade, études, impromptus, scherzos, preludes, and sonatas, some published only posthumously.</p>
     <p>Chopin's style was influenced by Polish folk music, the classical traidtion of J.S. Bach, Mozart, Schubert, and the atmosphere of the Paris salons.</p>
